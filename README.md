# Hotwheels API

This repository hosts the code for hotwheels API.

## Motivation

I've been wanting to make something like this for a while. Mostly to do more backend kind of programming and to help new developers. Free APIs is how I made a lot of my frontend projects when I was just getting started so I hope this is something people use to showcase their skills.
