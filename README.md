# DiecastDB

This repository hosts the code for the API that serves data from the [Hotwheels Wiki](https://hotwheels.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Wheels).

## Motivation

I've been wanting to make something like this for a while. Mostly to do more backend kind of programming and to help new developers. Free APIs are how I made a lot of my frontend projects when I was just getting started so I hope this is something people use to showcase their skills.
